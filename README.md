# Diamonds-Classifications
* Given dataset of Diamonds with features I have preprocessed data using different libraries such as Pandas, Numpy etc.
* Did Correlation analysis between features.
* Performed feature engineering, feature enconding and scaling.
* Lastly, I've applied different regression models (Linear, Lasso, AdaBoost, Ridge, GradientBoosting, RandomForest, KNN) and compared their predictive accuracy.
